        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first-year pre-business major studying at the University of California, Riverside. With experiences in leadership, support, and communicating, I am able to sell products or ideas comfortably to new people. As a young adult looking to enter the job market, I took part in different business-related clubs on campus, such as the Undergraduate Business Association, in order to develop my knowledge and skills. Although participating in clubs is not merely enough to stand out, I value learning and experiences the most as they provide a strong foundation for whatâ€™s to come in the future. I have also participated in various work environments, ranging from my high school roboticâ€™s club to being a clinical assistant at a chiropractic clinic. In either environment, I strived at talking to strangers and providing answers to their questions, partly due to a class I took on public speaking. After a long series of taking on tasks that involve communicative involvement, I hope to move on by leading others and to grow their skills in presenting. For this to happen, I plan on taking up higher positions within the clubs I am already in and use that as a medium to achieve my ambitions.<br><br>

        My high school robotics team included a business branch within the club, in charge of marketing, fundraising, and keeping track of the budget. Team 5026, otherwise known as the Iron Panthers, participated in competitions nationally hosted by the First Robotics Competition organization. Over my four years with this club, I had the privilege to learn and practice various skills such as public speaking and using business-oriented programs and learn under mentors involved in the field of business, which would help me apply for different positions today. By my fourth year, I was leading our business branch and communicating with different sponsors, event organizers, and even our town council to expose our brand name as much as possible. Coming to the end of the competing season, our team was able to travel to Houston, Texas to participate in an international competition with various teams around the world, which the Iron Panthers would go on and take first place in. This victory is not just credited to all the money and funds the business branch was able to accumulate, but also the programing branch and engineering branch producing a great robot. I take this time of my life as a growing experience where I saw results and success through development. I was able to learn and eventually lead a dedicated group of individuals who had the same aspirations I had. <br><br>

        My time at the chiropractic clinic allowed me to familiarize myself with what it is like to work in a professional environment. At the clinic, I had to communicate with a lot of different people ranging from young adults to married professionals. I would schedule appointments by taking phone calls or talking to people who walk in, processed bank deposits using Microsoft Excel, and organized patient files and documents. As a part-time employee, there was not much room to grow in the sense that this job was only temporary, but the skills I acquired would be useful for me in the future. It was not my first time talking to strangers, so I become really comfortable with that part of the job, learning how to use different programs took a bit of time to learn but over the next week, I was capable of doing most things by myself, and always making sure that everything was organized became a habit
